          I’ve started working in casino in the beginning of 2004. Ever since I
          loved what I do and still working in gambling business for more than
          17 yeas now. But I didn’t stick to one place. Not long after I
          started, I’ve decide this job is giving me the opportunity to travel
          the world, so I did. At first went working in Agadir, Morocco. Spend
          there one year. And than an interesting started. Pass an interview and
          went working on a big and beautiful cruise ship. I loved it, and I
          stick to it for more than five years. Growth through the years, become
          a casino manager and been on this position for more than three years.
          One day I decide to settle down and come back home for good.

        And than it happened, pandemic came than lock down. And I got love for sating home with my laptop. I've always wanted to study and decide to take some courses from home. Bump into free online JavaScript course for beginners offered from software university (Softuni.bg). At first in the beginning it was very hard but I knew never to gave up. I’m finishing soon the last professional module JS web and soon will graduate. Now looking for new adventure to starting my internship and see the real thing from inside. Very exited about what is wet to come.
